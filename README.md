In this repository I'm sharing my notes about the first 4 chapters of the book Practical Statistics for Data Scientist of Peter and Andrew Bruce.

Originally in the book the concepts are presented as R code but I started replicating it to Python. Later on, I decided to change to R in order to practice with both languages.

You will find a lot of comments about the concepts. That's me making my own ideas. Maybe in a future I will continue with the other chapters, but for now, I decided to stop because my field of expertise is not about statistics, I just wanted to review the basics of it. I think data scientists should have a strong knowledge of statistics, and my intention is to be more like a analyst right now, thats where I am.
